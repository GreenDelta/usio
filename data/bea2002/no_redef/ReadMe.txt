Documentation for the 2002 Benchmark Input-Output Accounts: 
Detailed Make Table and Use Table before Redefinitions 

Source
 The data in these files were prepared by the Industry
 Benchmark Division (IBD), Bureau of Economic Analysis,  
 U.S. Department of Commerce.  For questions about the 
 tables, please call the IBD main number (202-606-5585), or 
 FAX (202-606-5316), or send an E-Mail message to 
 benchmarkio@bea.gov.

Use of tables
  Tables 1 and 2, NAICSMakeDetail.txt and NAICSUseDetail.txt, are provided 
  in a row, column, value format, rather than the traditional matrix.  This format 
  allows the file to display the transactions in producers’ value, purchasers’ value, 
  and all of the trade and transportation margins.  The data are compatible with 
  current versions of Microsoft Excel as well as with statistical software  
  such as Quattro Pro and SAS. These programs can support the file size 
  as well as read and convert the delimited files.  A spreadsheet, database, or 
  statistical program can be used to create custom cross-tabulated tables with the 
  data set.  If you have further questions regarding use of these files please 
  contact the Industry Benchmark Division at benchmarkio@bea.gov.
